Depends on the following R packages:
  ts (included in the R distribution).
 ___________________________________________________________________________
| This package uses a previously written library, Meschach - a numerical
| library of C routines for performing calculations on matrices and vectors.
| (This is a deprecated message. We implemented the API of meschach from scratch.)
|__________________________________________________________________________
Meschach is written by David E. Stewart (david.stewart@anu.edu.au) and Zbigniew
Leyk (zbigniew.leyk@anu.edu.au). Thanks to Stewart and Leyk for this
important contribution.

This package is "*nix Only" at this time. We plan to make it available in
other platforms (as many as possible) in the shortest time. You may
self-compile the meschach implementation and the loglikelihood.c, then, link them
and produce a mgarchBEKK.so (or mgarchBEKK.dll in Win32 platform) and use the package that.
